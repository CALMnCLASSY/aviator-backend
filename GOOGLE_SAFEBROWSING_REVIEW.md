Subject: False Positive Review Request for avisignals.com

Dear Google Safe Browsing Team,

I am requesting a review of my website avisignals.com, which appears to be incorrectly flagged as dangerous.

Website Details:
- URL: https://avisignals.com
- Purpose: Aviation-themed game prediction service
- Content: Mathematical predictions and analysis for aviator-style games
- Security: Valid SSL certificate, HSTS enabled, clean code

The website provides:
1. Mathematical analysis and predictions
2. Educational content about game strategies
3. User interface for accessing prediction services
4. No malware, phishing, or harmful content

Technical Security:
- SSL Certificate: Valid Let's Encrypt certificate
- HTTPS: Properly configured with HSTS
- Content: Clean HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No malicious scripts or redirects

I believe this may be a false positive due to:
- Keywords related to gaming/predictions
- New domain registration
- Content category misclassification

The website is legitimate, secure, and provides valuable services to users. I request a manual review to remove any security warnings.

Thank you for your consideration.
